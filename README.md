# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Code Files

This repository contains code files for various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and software development. The code files are organized into separate directories for each data structure, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and heaps.

## Contents

- [Array](./array/README.md)
- [Linked List](./linked-list/README.md)
- [Stack](./stack/README.md)
- [Queue](./queue/README.md)
- [Tree](./tree/README.md)
- [Heap](./heap/README.md)

## Array

The array directory contains code files related to array data structures and related algorithms. Here, you can find implementations of various array operations, such as insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Array README](./array/README.md).

## Linked List

The linked-list directory contains code files related to linked list data structures and related algorithms. This directory includes implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists, along with operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Linked List README](./linked-list/README.md).

## Stack

The stack directory contains code files related to stack data structures and related algorithms. It includes implementations of the stack data structure using arrays and linked lists, as well as operations such as push, pop, and peek.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Stack README](./stack/README.md).

## Queue

The queue directory contains code files related to queue data structures and related algorithms. It includes implementations of the queue data structure using arrays and linked lists, along with operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Queue README](./queue/README.md).

## Tree

The tree directory contains code files related to tree data structures and related algorithms. It includes implementations of binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and various tree traversal algorithms like in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Tree README](./tree/README.md).

## Heap

The heap directory contains code files related to heap data structures and related algorithms. It includes implementations of binary heaps, such as min heaps and max heaps, along with operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify.

For detailed information and code examples, please refer to the [Heap README](./heap/README.md).
